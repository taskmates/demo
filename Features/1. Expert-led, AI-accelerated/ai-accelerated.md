@taskmates how do you mean Human-centric, AI-accelerated?

**taskmates** Hey there! When we say "Human-centric, AI-accelerated", we mean that with Taskmates:

👩‍💻 **You're the expert, and the IDE is your tool.** We're developers ourselves, and we get it - AI isn't there yet to fully replace us. 

🤝 Taskmates blend seamlessly with **your personal workflow, tools, and IDE**. You can incrementally adopt only what's useful for you.

🎛️ **You keep full control** at all times:
- Watch, interrupt, add details, and change your Taskmates' actions whenever you want
- Have them take over from where you left off, or take over from where they are when you need to

🚀 For some tasks, you can **focus on goal-setting** while watching the AI write full code, test it, make its own adjustments, and deliver working code.

So in a nutshell, Taskmates put you, the developer, at the center while using AI to accelerate your workflow in a way that keeps you in control!

Let me know if you have any other questions!
